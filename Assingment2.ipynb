    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it is important to inherit from the built-in Exception class (or one of its subclasses). This practice ensures that your custom exception behaves correctly within Python's exception handling framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Inheriting from Exception ensures that your custom exception integrates seamlessly with Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms. This makes it consistent with other exceptions in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Hierarchy: Python's exception system is built on a hierarchy of classes, with BaseException at the top, followed by Exception and other subclasses. By inheriting from Exception, your custom exception becomes part of this hierarchy, which helps in organizing and managing errors systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling: When your custom exception inherits from Exception, it can be caught using standard try-except blocks. This allows for more flexible and powerful error handling.\n",
    "Traceback Information: Custom exceptions that inherit from Exception automatically include traceback information when raised. This makes debugging easier, as you get detailed information about where and why the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility: Some functions and libraries might expect exceptions to be subclasses of Exception. By inheriting from Exception, you ensure compatibility with such functions and libraries."
